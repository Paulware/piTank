<h1>IR - Infrared Transmitting and Receiving</h1>
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared">infra-red</a> transmitter and receiver 
allows an Arduino microcontroller to communicate with another arduino (which has an ir receiver)<br>

To receive an ir pulse the Arduino needs to sample the data pin quickly.<br>
A timer interrupt is created which allows the Arduino to read the data pin at a 50 microsecond rate.  <br>
That is 20000 times a second.<br>
A pulse is considered "long" when it is on for 750 microseconds or longer a pulse is considerd "short" when it is less than 750 microseconds in duration<br>
The long pulses are viewed as 1 and short pulses are viewed as 0.<br> 
In between each light pulse is an "off" or darkness which usually is always the same length of time (about 1 millisecond).
Putting all the 1's and 0's together gives you the data value.  For example 1000 represents the value 8. 1101 represents 13.
These 1's and zeroes are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary numbers</a>.
