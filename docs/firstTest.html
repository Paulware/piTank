  <h2>TODO: Make the first test: wifi access point only</h2>
  <h3>Command the Motor Driver</h3>
    In this first test we will power on the pi using an external power supply, run the server, and command the motor driver<br>
    For this test you will need: 
    <ol>
       <li>Raspberry pi 4</li>
       <li>sd Card flashed with latest raspbian and setup for ssh/wifi</li>
       <li>Free software Putty and Winscp</li>
       <li>Adeept Hat</li>
       <li>Volt Meter</li>
       <li>12-V power adapter</li>
    </ol>  
    <hr>
    You will not need: A vehicle, or the camera<br>
    
    <h3>Some options</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Don't need a vehicle</h4><br>
          This first test we just want to make sure we can control the motor output, but we are also testing
          our power supply, and the wifi access point, as well as getting used to the software (putty and winscp).<br>
          </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/7-function-digital-multimeter-63759.html">Harbor freight has a voltmeter</a> for about $7.00.<br>
          The motor output will positive and negative DC voltage (for forward and reverse).  I built a little test rig that 
          connected the motor output directly to the voltmeter.  This is optional, but makes testing easier</li> 
    </ol>
