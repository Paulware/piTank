<h2>Notes:</h2>
   The UwTerminalX (See setup directory) is the only known terminal program that can interface with this device <br>
   I used a cp2102 configured for 3.3V output<br>
   Here is a snapshot of a working configuration:<br>
   Don't use nano 3.3V to power device(not enough power)<br>
   DVID and RFID should match for two units to communicate<br>
   Can use TX of Nano to transmit to other device <br>
   Can use Diode to reduce voltage of 18650 within range<br>
   Tx pin actually receives data, if only receiving, ground rx pin<br>
