<H1>How to Port Forward (MediaCom)</H1>
<ul>
  <li><h2>Determine location of router (probably 192.168.0.1)</h2><br>
       To determine the location of the router run ipconfig:<br>
       Hold the windows key and press the "r" key<br>
       Enter cmd<br>
         <img src="images/windowsR.jpg"><br>
       Enter ipconfig<br>
         <img src="images/ipconfig.jpg"><br>
       The address of the Default Gateway is the local ip address of your router <br>                
  </li>
  <li><h2>Login to the router config page</h2><br>
       Open a browser and enter the ip address of your router (probably 192.168.0.1), ignore the not-secure messages, if they appear<br>
       At this point you will probably need to call Media Com.  Let them know you are trying to "port forward".  Have a recent copy of your bill because they will ask for your pin.  <br>
       Also if you are not 18, have your parents nearby, because Media Com will need their permission to continue<br>
       Media will let you know your user name and password, stay on the line with them as you login<br>
