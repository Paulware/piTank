<h1>ESP32 Web-Cam</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
   <li>The ESP32 Web Cam <b>shall</b> have a fish-eye lens to improve angle visibility</li>
   <li>The ESP32 Web Cam <b>shall</b> have an antenna to reduce network lag</li>
   <li>The ESP32 Web Cam <b>shall</b> be powered from the 5V regulator located in the chasis</li>
   <li>The ESP32 Web Cam <b>shall</b> have a unique static ip address and port assigned for each tank</li>
   <li>The ESP32 Web Cam <b>shall</b> stream its output to a web-page</li>   
   <li>The ESP32 Web Cam <b>shall</b> be located in the tank-commander's cupola</li>   
</ul>
<h2>What you need to know:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>When this web-cam logs into the network, the router will tell it its ip address.</li>
  <li>Each web-cam will have its own port where the camera page is visible</li>
  <li>This port and ip address needs to be "port-forwarded" to the outside internet</li>   
</ol>
<h2>Extra info</h2>
   The arduino sketch contains the port for each web-cam and must be modified and "flashed" on each device.<br>
   This device requires a 3.3V power supply which comes from the chasis<br>
