<h1>Joystick and Receiver</h1>
The pizero W has a bluetooth chip (as well as wifi chip). <br>
 The bluetooth chip can communicate with a cheap HC-06 receiver, but some setup is required.
 <ol>
    <li>Once prior to communication the pi needs to pair with the HC-06 (password=1234)</li>
    <li>Each time the pi boots up, the pi needs to <a href="https://paulware.github.io/piTank/docs/bindHc06.html">bind the HC-06 to a serial port</a></li>
 </ol>
 This piHat is available from ebay for about $15.00 and has a mini joystick and buttons.<br>
 This provides basic bluetooth communication with no noticeable lag<br>

A raspberry pi zero is cheaper than a raspberry pi 3 or 4 which is really overkill for this type of function<br>
All that is required is that we send a few characters 3 or 4 times a second and respond to a joystick.
<br>
<h1>Setup</h1>
The facilitate the pairing with HC-06 without needing an hdmi display.  The pi's wifi<br>
chip is used to create an access point.  A laptop can then connect to the pi and pair with <br>
the hc-06 using a windows terminal program (like putty) on the laptop, and the bluetooth<br>
control manager on the pi<br>
<h1>Wiring</H1>
The HC-06 has 3 pins that are connected to an arduino nano: 
<ul>
   <li>VCC to 5V (3.3V will not work)</li>
   <li>Gnd to Gnd</li>
   <li>Tx on HC-06 connected to pin D0 (Rx) on the Arduino Nano</li>
</ul>

An alternate solution is to connect the tx pin on the HC-06 to a different pin on the nano<br>
and use the software serial library.<br> 

It is a little simpler just to connect to the arduino nanos D0 (rx) pin and then use Serial.read() to<br>
read characters.  One note is that you will need to disconnect the HC-06 when flashing the arduino as the <br>
rx pin is used to flash the nano.
