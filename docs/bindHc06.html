<h1>Binding HC-06 on boot up</h1>
   Each time the raspberry pi boots up the command file: /etc/rc.local is run.<br>
   In this file you can command the pi to bind (as long as it previously paired), but you <br>
   need to know the mac address of the HC-06 blue tooth device.<br>
    For example if the mac address of the HC-06 is 
   Your /etc/rc.local file would look like this:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh -e
rfcomm bind 0 98:D3:31:20:53:D4 1
exit 0
</pre>

This code above binds the HC-06 with mac address: 98:D3:31:20:53:D4 to rfcomm0 on channel 1<br>
This occurs everytime the raspberry pi boots up.
