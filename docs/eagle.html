<H1>Eagle from Autodesk</H1>
Eagle is a free cad program that allows you to lay out printed-circuit-board (PCB)s.<br>
PCBs handle all the wiring so all you need to do is solder in the components.<br>
Eagle is available for download <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/eagle-download-win">here</a> for windows.<br>
This project uses 3 pcbs that are combined in one layout: 
<ul>
   <li>Bluetooth Joystick pcb</li>
   <li>Pi Hat pcb</li>
   <li>Upper tank pcb (for infra-red transmit and receive, turret movement and pixels)</li>
</ul>
