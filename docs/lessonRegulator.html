<h1>Voltage Regulator</h1>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
  These devices are found on ebay for about $0.50: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/2x-LM2596-DC-DC-Adjustable-Step-Down-Power-Module-7V-35V-to-1-25V-30V-3A-DC-DC/323273762102?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649">here</a><br>
  There are little big, but extremely reliable.   I've never had one that actually failed<br>
  We use 2 of them on our project.   Both take the battery 7.4V as input.<br>
  One is used for the Camera 3.3V and passed from the chasis to the turret<br>
  One is used for the arduino-nano at 5v, but possibly 3.3V could work for that also<br>
  The only issue is that the turret motor uses 5V to drive but that could be obtained from the H-Bridge<br>

<h2>Homework</h2>
  Attach the input to at least 7 V or more it can handle 30V DC<br>
  Then use the screw adjust and a voltmeter to change the voltage output to 5v and 3.3V<br>
