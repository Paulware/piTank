### VGA Controller, PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard Controller, Graphics Library, Sound Engine, Graphical User Interface (GUI), Game Engine and ANSI/VT Terminal for the **ESP32**

This library works with ESP32 revision 1 or upper. See [**Compatible Boards**][Boards].

VGA output requires a digital to analog converter (DAC): it can be done by three 270 Ohm resistors to have 8 colors, or by 6 resistors to have 64 colors.

Three fixed width fonts are embedded to best represents 80x25 or 132x25 text screen, at 640x350 resolution. However other fonts are embedded, even with variable width.

Sprites can have up to 64 colors (RGB, 2 bits per channel + transparency).
A sprite has associated one o more bitmaps, even of different size. Bitmaps (frames) can be selected in sequence to create animations.
Unlimited number of sprites are supported. However big sprites and a large amount of them reduces the frame rate and could generate flickering.

When there is enough memory (on low resolutions like 320x200), it is possible to allocate two screen buffers, so to implement double buffering.
In this case drawing primitives always draw on the back buffer.

Except for double buffering or when explicitly disabled, all drawings are performed on vertical retracing, so no flickering is visible.
If the queue of primitives to draw is not processed before the vertical retracing ends, then it is interrupted and continued at next retracing.

There is a graphical user interface (GUI) with overlapping windows and mouse handling and a lot of widgets (buttons, editboxes, checkboxes, comboboxes, listboxes, etc..).

Finally, there is a sound engine, with multiple channels mixed to a mono output. Each channel can generate sine waveforms, square, etc... or custom sampled data.
